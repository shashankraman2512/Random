# text_analytics



Different APIs for text analytics and SEMANTIC ANALYSIS using machine learning were tried including :

Algorithmia - Many text analytics, NLP and entity extraction algorithms are available as part of their cloud based offering
Algorithmia algorithms tried out include: 
- Part of speech tagging using OpenNLP: http://opennlp.apache.org/
The Part of Speech Tagger marks tokens with their corresponding word type based on the token itself and the context of the token. A token might have multiple pos tags depending on the token and the context. The OpenNLP POS Tagger uses a probability model to predict the correct pos tag out of the tag set. To limit the possible tags for a token a tag dictionary can be used which increases the tagging and runtime performance of the tagger. Parts are tagged according to the conventions of the Penn Treebank Project (https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html). For example, a plural noun is denoted NNS, a singular or mass noun is NN, and a determiner (such as a/an, every, no, the,another, any, some, each, etc.) as DT.
